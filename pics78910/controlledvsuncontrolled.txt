The difference is React developers don't want to reach into HTML DOM world to reach for input value of user
When user press a key, react process that information first, then display the key to search bar

render(){
<input>
value = {this.state.term} #state is currently storing 'car'
onChange = {e => this.sestState(...} #user press 's' key
#input gets rerendered

#rerendering
<input>
value = {this.state.term} #state is now 'cars'
